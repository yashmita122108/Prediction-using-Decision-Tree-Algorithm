# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm

Decision trees are a powerful and intuitive tool that has proven its efficacy in solving classification and regression problems. This approach is not only used for understanding data but also for making predictions. In this context, the purpose of this project is to create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The objective revolves around developing a Decision Tree classifier that is not only capable of accurately categorizing data but can also provide a visual representation of its decision-making process. The primary goal is to empower this classifier to handle new, previously unseen data and predict the right class with precision.
Through the implementation of this Decision Tree classifier, we aim to demonstrate how it can be harnessed to solve real-world problems and offer insights into its decision-making process. Furthermore, we will showcase the importance of visualizing the decision tree, as it provides a clear and intuitive way to understand how the model reaches its predictions.

This task not only serves as an educational exploration of the Decision Tree algorithm but also as a practical solution to the broader challenge of making data-driven predictions. By the end of this endeavor, we will have a tool at our disposal that can take new data as input and predict the appropriate class, enhancing decision-making and facilitating more informed choices.
The graph of a Decision Tree Classifier algorithm provides a visual representation of how the algorithm makes decisions and predicts classes based on the input features. It's a valuable tool for understanding the model's structure, identifying important features, and assessing the model's performance and potential for overfitting.
